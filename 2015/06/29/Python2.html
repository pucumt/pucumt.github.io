		<h1> Python1- Features </h1>

		<p>Python is more and more famous now, but I don't have much time to use it in my normal dev. works, because I think it is hard to use to compare with C#, someone may say there are more libraries in Python than in C#. Yes, but still like C# more, because:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>C# has a very wonderful <strong>IDE</strong>, use VS you could find the library all classes, all public methods very easy, but how about python?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don't like Python <strong>thread mechanism</strong>, when the child thread is running, you cannot stop the parent process(when without setDaemon).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I like the C# paragraph, once with <strong>brackets</strong>, it is easy to expend or close, I don't think Python can do it(the code paragraph inside methods).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>C# need reflect to see the code after <strong>compile</strong>, but Python code is open source, I do like Python this feature, but this is why Python is slow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Windbg is very easy to <strong>dubug the core</strong> and system memory, but how about Python?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>C# could compile to <strong>machine code</strong>(windows), how about Python?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is very easy to code both winform and webform in C#, how about Python?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am very sure which library is official and stable, but in Python, so many libraries, which one is the correct one you wanted?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Of course there are some features in Python is very well either:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Cross platform</strong>, it is very easy to run both in windows and linux, I don't know why .net don't support it for so many years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Python is <strong>open source</strong>, it is very useful to people who need learn a language, especially to the guys without coding experience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Huge of libraries</strong>, I do like the libraries, it is very easy to solve some difficult things. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Force every method is small and every each code level should indent.</p>
</li>
</ol>
