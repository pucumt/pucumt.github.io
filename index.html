					<p>There are many tool to catch the internet data, I usually use Fiddler, and most of the time it is enough, but sometimes need use network monitor or wireshark. But after a times of no use, I need google again the way to use it. And now I am going to remember the way to use network monitor. </p>
<p>Steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Select the network that you want to capture.</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/pucumt/pucumt.github.io/blob/master/Images/network1.png?raw=true" /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Set the filter that you want to check</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/pucumt/pucumt.github.io/blob/master/Images/network2.png?raw=true" /></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I believe the most useful skill is about filter to find the data that you really want.</p>
<p>And to wireshark only show one filter.</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/pucumt/pucumt.github.io/blob/master/Images/network3.png?raw=true" /></p>
<p>Tools are just tools, but it really useful!</p>

					<h2><a class="postlink" href="/2015/06/29/Python1.html">Python1- Features</a></h2>
					<div class="postdate">29 June, 2015
						<ul>
						
						</ul>
					</div>
					<p>Python is more and more famous now, but I don't have much time to use it in my normal dev. works, because I think it is hard to use to compare with C#, someone may say there are more libraries in Python than in C#. Yes, but still like C# more, because:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>C# has a very wonderful <strong>IDE</strong>, use VS you could find the library all classes, all public methods very easy, but how about python?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don't like Python <strong>thread mechanism</strong>, when the child thread is running, you cannot stop the parent process(when without setDaemon).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I like the C# paragraph, once with <strong>brackets</strong>, it is easy to expend or close, I don't think Python can do it(the code paragraph inside methods).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>C# need reflect to see the code after <strong>compile</strong>, but Python code is open source, I do like Python this feature, but this is why Python is slow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Windbg is very easy to <strong>dubug the core</strong> and system memory, but how about Python?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>C# could compile to <strong>machine code</strong>(windows), how about Python?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is very easy to code both winform and webform in C#, how about Python?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am very sure which library is official and stable, but in Python, so many libraries, which one is the correct one you wanted?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Of course there are some features in Python is very well either:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Cross platform</strong>, it is very easy to run both in windows and linux, I don't know why .net don't support it for so many years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Python is <strong>open source</strong>, it is very useful to people who need learn a language, especially to the guys without coding experience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Huge of libraries</strong>, I do like the libraries, it is very easy to solve some difficult things. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Force every method is small and every each code level should indent.</p>
</li>
</ol>

					<h2><a class="postlink" href="/2015/06/12/To analysis the requirement.html">Analysis the requirements</a></h2>
					<div class="postdate">12 June, 2015
						<ul>
						
						</ul>
					</div>
					<p>Now in China it is very hard to hire a developer with some ability. So most of the times you must try to training the YPP by yourself, and there are some skills of my experience.</p>
<p>Situations:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Requirement totally not clear:</strong> There are some logic about the requirement, and the requirement only with some sentence, you don't know where is the module.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> <strong>Ask</strong> the requirement owner or your PM, sounds very easy, but most of the YPP don't like ask questions, and one day later the PM to check the process, you are still reads the requirement and read some codes no relationship with the requirement.   
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cannot describe requirement clearly:</strong> Most of the time, you know a little of the requirement, but when you describe the logic to your PM, you cannot say it clearly.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Actually you are not clear about the full logic, and you are not familiar with the module, so you can use some <strong>charts/screen shots</strong> to help you explain the functions maybe in meeting or in your email.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Logic is too complex:</strong> This is also very normal to the YPP, and usually you may think you understand it, but once implement the function, there are so many situations(branches) about the logic, you don't know to start.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> This time you could use table or work flow to help you manage the function. </p>
<p>If there are many situations but not many steps, use <strong>table</strong>:</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/pucumt/pucumt.github.io/blob/master/Images/Requirement1.png?raw=true" /></p>
<p>If there are many steps of the function, use <strong>work flow charts</strong>:</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/pucumt/pucumt.github.io/blob/master/Images/Requirement2.png?raw=true" /></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Actions of PM:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Meetings to <strong>review the requirements</strong>, everyone must join and show their requirements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Meetings to <strong>review the process</strong>, this is very important, only this could help you keep the project go forward.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Training</strong> of computer skills, this may not that important once have the point 4, but it is still very useful.  
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Point a senior to <strong>help</strong> a YPP, and tell the YPP to think first before ask questions. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You must have enough <strong>estimate</strong> to the training time and meeting time.  
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The project is really hard to manage than before now, if you have the same situation with me, maybe this could help your a little, and if you also have some other experiences, you can contact me with my email either.</p>

					<h2><a class="postlink" href="/2015/04/28/DebugUseMDBG.html">To debug in production with MDBG</a></h2>
					<div class="postdate">28 April, 2015
						<ul>
						
						</ul>
					</div>
					<p>Even now I still heard some company using remote debug or install VS in production. This is really a very bad behavior. And this is one solution to debug in production.</p>
<p>Location: #InstallDir#\Microsoft Visual Studio 8\SDK\v2.0\Bin</p>
<p>Steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Copy the full folder to production</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/pucumt/pucumt.github.io/blob/master/Images/MDBG1.png?raw=true" /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open Mdbg</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/pucumt/pucumt.github.io/blob/master/Images/MDBG2.png?raw=true" /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To learn a tool or a new language, the most important things is to learn the help</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/pucumt/pucumt.github.io/blob/master/Images/MDBG3.png?raw=true" /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For now it is very easy to do anything you wanted, and this is an example of using Mdbg.</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/pucumt/pucumt.github.io/blob/master/Images/MDBG4.png?raw=true" /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once I click button &quot;button1&quot;, it will throw an exception, let's see what's going on in mdbg.</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/pucumt/pucumt.github.io/blob/master/Images/MDBG5.png?raw=true" /></p>
<p>It told us the exception is in method WinDBGT1.TestException.GetException of line 11.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now if show lines even with source in the folder, still show the error</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/pucumt/pucumt.github.io/blob/master/Images/MDBG6.png?raw=true" /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Again rerun the exe with pdb file(assume you understand the pdb file is symbol file) and command sh</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/pucumt/pucumt.github.io/blob/master/Images/MDBG7.png?raw=true" /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Almost done, except the pdb location is changed after move to production. So you can change the pdb location path or change the file path.</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/pucumt/pucumt.github.io/blob/master/Images/MDBG8.png?raw=true" /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Actually there are a lot of functions in Mdbg, for example to create and read dump, so no need to debug in production, just get the dump to check all issues.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>And here is the link of msdn with Mdbg: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms229861.aspx</p>

					<h2><a class="postlink" href="/2015/04/23/UseLDAPserver.html">Use LDAP server to authenticate user identity</a></h2>
					<div class="postdate">23 April, 2015
						<ul>
						
						</ul>
					</div>
					<p>In the group company, the employees' account and password are all recorded in LDAP server, and usually there are SSO login needed, or the apps need login with the account exists in LDAP server. About the basic technology of LDAP server, you could search it from internet.  I just wanted to talk about <strong>how to use it to authenticate a user login</strong>. And if your IT is really good at LDAP server and could told you about the LDAP structure, please ignore this article. </p>
<p>My situation</p>
<ol>
<li>I don't know the base DN, and I don't know where to get that.</li>
<li>I know the LDAP server address and port, and lucky I get one of the LDAP server acccount could be used to search infos.</li>
</ol>
<p>The steps to get LDAP structure:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Download a LDAP server management tools(like Softerra LDAP Administrator)
   By default, it will login some LDAP servers, I am not if this only exists in Softera LdAP Administrator or not.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a new profile to the LDAP server(notice the port).</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/pucumt/pucumt.github.io/blob/master/Images/LDAP1.png?raw=true" /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click next and input the account that could search in LDAP server
Usually the user will be cn=XXX or uid=XXX, that's both OK.</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/pucumt/pucumt.github.io/blob/master/Images/LDAP2.png?raw=true" /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After input account, the LDAP structure will be displayed. And here is my LDAP structure:</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/pucumt/pucumt.github.io/blob/master/Images/LDAP3.png?raw=true" /></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>And now it is easy to code with any computer language to authenticate a user exists or not.</p>
<p>As for user password authenticate, you can try to find the way by yourself.</p>
<p>And also a way to check your filter is correct or not:</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/pucumt/pucumt.github.io/blob/master/Images/LDAP4.png?raw=true" /></p>
